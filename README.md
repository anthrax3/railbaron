=head1 Command line <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rail_Baron">Rail Baron</A> utilities

Simple command line utilitied written in perl to do payout lookups and
roll destinations in a game of <A
HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rail_Baron>Rail Baron</A>.

Nice to play the game without using the lookup tables. Not designed to
be anything more than a playing aid.  You still need the game itself.
